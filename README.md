Iris Flower Classification
Overview
The Iris Flower Classification is a common machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. The dataset used for this classification task, known as the Iris dataset, is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and is often used as a beginner's dataset.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and train a machine learning model for the Iris flower classification task.

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The flowers belong to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.

The dataset is provided in the iris data.csv file, which contains the feature values for each sample, along with the corresponding class labels.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.0 or above
NumPy
Pandas
sklearn

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, which is the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples.

The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set, which was not used during training, to provide an unbiased estimate of its performance.

Results
The results of the model's evaluation on the test set will be displayed in the console. The accuracy achieved by the model will be shown as a percentage.
